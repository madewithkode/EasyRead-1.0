# EasyRead-1.0
A Python App aimed at making reading PDFs more fun. Currently able to run as a desktop app on Ubuntu(provided necessary requirements are intalled) thanks to python's standard GUI library Tkinter. Windows.exe version coming soon.

EasyRead as a project was started by Onyenanu Princewill, but has now been made open source, so as to get others to contribute.
